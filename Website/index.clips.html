<h4><strong> The Diamondback</strong> </h4>
<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2024/04/17/maryland-gymnastics-emma-silberman/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> Emma Silberman ends Maryland gymnastics career with spot in NCAA Championships</a> | <i> April 17, 2024 </h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> I pitched this story after one of the best University of Maryland gymnasts made history. Emma Silberman was the first Maryland gymnast since 2001 to compete in the NCAA national championship. I spoke with Emma and her coach Brett Nelligan to insight behind the journey she went on from her freshman year to her fifth year on the team. I dove into the Maryland gymnastics record book and discovered cool anecdotes in her interview to eventually highlight her career into one article.</li></h6>
</ul>
<br>
<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2024/03/06/maryland-gymnastics-practice-public-health-school/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> Maryland gymnastics fills its practices with energy, detailed feedback</a> | <i> March 6, 2024 </h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> I pitched this story after a random thought. I wondered what a typical collegiate gymnastics practice consisted of as there are many gymnasts, different events to practice, and limited equipment to train with. I attended a practice one afternoon and stayed nearly four hours to take in the full experience. The story was also captured in a video element, with interview and various shots. The article portion expanded on the amount of mediums used to create a visually appealing story to the community.</li></h6>

<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2024/02/16/maryland-gymnastics-floor-routine-rupauls-drag-race-taylor-rech/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> RuPaul’s Drag Race among inspirations for Maryland gymnastics’ floor routines
</a> | <i> February 16, 2024 </h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> My favorite gymnastics event is floor exercise. I interview Maryland's head coach Brett Nelligan and gymnast Taylor Rech to ask what the process of creating a floor routine is like. The answer: hours and hours of repretition, all started the summer before the season. I dug into the team's former routines to find consistent patterns and ways to make the story more intriguing. </li></h6>
</ul>
<br>
<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2024/03/10/maryland-gymnastics-score-recap-result-towson/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> Maryland gymnastics scores a 196.725, earns narrow win over Towson
</a> | <i> March 10, 2024 </h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> I reported this article from Towson University, watching Maryland take on Towson in-person. This experience gave me more insight into traveling to catch a meet and report on in in-person rather than watching it through a live broadcast. I conducted reports in front of my eyes and felt the energy to write a better story. I conducted post-game interviews for more raw emotions instead of interview via a phone call. </li></h6>
</ul>
<br>
<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2023/10/27/maryland-womens-soccer-winless-big-ten/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> Maryland women’s soccer should’ve taken a step forward this year. It didn’t — here’s why.</a> | <i> October 27, 2023 </h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> This story was a season recap on the women's soccer team's scoreless conference season. Despite the topic being a difficult subject to ask about, I interviewed head coach Meghan Ryan Nemzer to get her perspective on how she thought her team ended up in that position and what they can do to improve moving forward. I tapped into old program records and created various topic points that highlighted where they failed to show positive signs throughout the season.  </li></h6>
</ul>
<br>
<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2023/10/12/maryland-womens-soccer-megan-ryan-nemzer-rutgers/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> Maryland women’s soccer’s loss to Rutgers gave Meghan Ryan Nemzer a chance to reflect</a> | <i> October 12, 2023 </h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> After Maryland women's soccer's loss to Rutgers, I caught up with head coach Nemzer to talk about her history with Rutgers women's soccer and what the game meant to her. I was able to find interesting stories from her time with the Scarlet Knights to fully form a story on why she was emotional following her team's loss. </li></h6>
</ul>
<br>
<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2023/09/24/maryland-womens-soccer-score-recap-result-ohio-state/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> Maryland women’s soccer concedes in 90th minute, falls to Ohio State, 1-0</a> | <i> September 24, 2023</h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> Maryland women's soccer lost in the final minute of a game against Ohio State. The team nearly outlasted a tough opponent but was disappointed after playing a solid 89 minutes. I conducted a thorough research of the game up until the goal and asked hard-hitting questions as to why they thought the goal occured suddenly. </li></h6>
</ul>
<br>
<h5><a href="https://dbknews.com/2024/04/30/luke-hemmings-boy-ep/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"> Luke Hemmings shakes off his past with new EP</a> | <i> April 30, 2024</h5>
<ul>
<h6> <li> I pitched this story idea to the diversion desk at The Diamondback. I wanted to experiment with different styles of journalism and thought a music review was another way to learn. I dug into each track of "Boy" by Luke Hemmings, a new EP at the time. I researched through various print, radio, and TV interviews to uncover the meaning behind lyrics and songs. Eventually, I gave the songs and EP my own interpretation along with informing the reader of Hemmings' interpretation of the songs.</li></h6>

<ul>
<h6> <li> I wanted to explore other styles of writing. The world of cinema had a theater attendance in 2023, making it harder for 2024 to follow suit. I chose seven movies that any audience could enjoy in the theater.</li></h6>

<ul>
<h6> <li> I attended an airing of 'Drop the Pop', a weekly pop culture radio show on campus. The girls sit around a circle discussing similar interests and the current state of celebrities, television, music, and more. I captured tight, medium, and wide shots to show the club's main message and state every Monday evening. I used a DSLR camera. Video for JOUR347A.</li></h6>

<h6> <li> Recorded turtle paintings in studio A at STAMP Student Union for Maryland Day Video. I spoke with students, parents, kids, and staff at the event to get an understanding for the importance of art. I conducted tight, wide, and medium shots, and multiple interviews with a wireless microphone. Video for JOUR347A.</li></h6>

<ul>
<h6> <li> For my journalism codin class, we had to create a website with a reported piece. I decided to take on the task to ask UMD students if they regret their majors or not, as many people ultimately change their intended major from freshman year. I provided graphs and pull quotes, and found many reasons why students change and their thoughts on the decision. The page is entirely coded by me, and the article and data is all conducted by me as well. Data project for JOUR352.</li></h6>
